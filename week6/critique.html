    Critique</h1>
    <h2>Three Design Practices Implemented Well</h2>
    <dl>
       <dt>1) Repetition</dt> 
       <dd>The site does a good job of using the same color scheme using different shades of blue. It also does very well using the same font family (Georgia Serif) for H1, H2, and H3. Another example where it uses repition is in the page layout
        each of the pages are formated the same, with an image at the top and content underneath.</dd>
       <dt>2) Browser Capability</dt>
       <dd>I opened the website on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox and the site displayed properly on all three. The colors, fonts, font sizes all appeared the same
        in each browser.</dd>
       <dt>3) Navigation</dt>
       <dd>The navigation anchors are all the same on each site page and easy to use and navigate. The navitation also uses an unordered list.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Three Design Practices That Could Be Iproved</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>1) Contract</dt>
        <dd>I don't think the body color contrasts enough from the background-color. I would also add more contrast for h3, and .resort to make them stand out more</dd>
           <li>Body - Change color from #ffffff to #002171</li>
           <li>h3 - Change color to #002171</li>
           <li>.resort - Change to font weight strong</li>
        <dt>2) Footer email</dt>
        <dd>The footers email address says send me an email, instead of the actual email address. I would list the actual email</dd>
            <li>Footer Email - Apply the anchor tag with href to mailto:myron.freebop@crazy.com. <a href="mailto:myron.freebop@crazy.com">myron.freebop@crazy.com</a></li>
        <dt>3) Make 'contact us' and Reservations page stand out</dt>
        <dd>On the Yurts page it states to contact us to make a reservation. I would hper link the 'contact us' to Reservations page. I would also make the reservations navigation stand out by changing the backgroun and font colors.</dd>
            <li>Contact Us - Apply the anchor tag with href to reservations.html.</li>
            <li>Reservations Navigation - Create id using "#res". Add following styles to background-color: #002171, and color: #ffffff</li>
    </dl>    
    <h2>How else would I improve the website</h2>
        <p>One way I would improve the website is better photos capturing the experience more. The pictures are nice, but I would add a photo gallery. The Yurt page only shows the outside
            of the yurt, where I personally would want to see the inside too. For the Activities, it should have pictures of all the activities. The current picture when I first landed on the page
            I wasn't sure what it was showing, but as I looked closer then I noticed the hiking trails. The reservations tab would be where I have a far away shot above the resort so you cans see that and the ocean. Also a photo as the sun is going down would
            be a good selling factor.</p>
