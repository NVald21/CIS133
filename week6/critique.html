    Critique</h1>
    <h2>Three Design Practices Well Implemented</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Repetition</li> 
       <p>The site does a good job of using the same color scheme using different shades of blue. It also does very well using the same font family (Georgia Serif) for H1, H2, and H3. </p>
       <li>Browser Capability</li>
       <p>I opened the website on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox and the site displayed properly on all three.</p>
       <li>Navigation</li>
       <p>The navigation anchors are all the same on each site page and easy to use and navigate.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Three Design Practices That Could Be Impelmented Better</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Has send me an email instead of the email address</li>
        <li>I would increase the contrast of the body color from #666666 to #000000. I would also increase the contrast color of H2 and .resort to stand out more. While providing repetition sticking to the same color scheme, I think it needs to pop more to stand out.</li>
        <p>Change body color from: #666666 to #000000<br>
           Change h2 color from #1976d2 to #002171<br>
           Add font weight to id.resort
        <li>I would also make the Reservations Navigation anchor stand out more along with under the Yurts page where it states Contact Us link to the Reservations page to make it more noticable.</li>
        <p>Create id #res<br>
            Apply background-color #002171<br>
            Apply font color #ffffff</p>
            Contact Us an anchor to Reservations <p>A variety of luxury yurt packages are available. Choose a package below and <a href="reservations.html">contact us</a> to begin your reservation. Weâ€™re happy to build a custom package just for you!</p>
